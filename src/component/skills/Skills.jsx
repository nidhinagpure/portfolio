                        As a web developer, I create dynamic and functional websites using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. 
                        I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly interfaces that enhance the user experience. 
                        Whether itâ€™s an e-commerce site, a blog, or a custom web application, I bring ideas to life through code.

                    <p>
                        UI design is all about aesthetics and usability. As a UI designer, I craft visually appealing layouts, 
                        choose color schemes, and create intuitive navigation. I pay attention to details like typography, spacing, 
                        and consistency. My designs aim to enhance the overall look and feel of your digital product.

                    <p>
                        UI (User Interface) development focuses on creating the visual elements of a website or application. 
                        I specialize in turning design mockups into interactive interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                        My goal is to ensure that users have a seamless and enjoyable experience while interacting with your product.
